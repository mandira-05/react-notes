state 

hume screen pe kya dikhana (render) h us k 2 ways h -
1st props
2nd state

prop vs state

1] props get passed to the components, state is managed within the component
2] props are immutable - q ki parent passdown krta h props to child component, parent own krta h props
state - is managed within component and can chnge state


3] in functional compents - props are accessed using props parameter, and in class props are accessed using this keyword
this.props
state - accesed using useState Hook in functional components
and in class is accessed by this keyword, this.state
